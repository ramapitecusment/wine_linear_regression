# Wine Linear Regression
One variable regression model

>###			**yi = β0 + β1xi + εi,   i=1,2, …, N**

**yi** - ith observation of dependent variable (wine price)
**xi** - ith observation of independent variable (AGST)
**εi** - error term for the ith observation 
**β0** - intercept coefficient
**β1** - regression coefficient for the independent variable
   
Good models have small error terms εi
